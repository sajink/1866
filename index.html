        Situated in the picturesque Melur, Thalassery, the Judge Bungalow is undergoing a remarkable metamorphosis into a premium heritage home, proudly donning the name "The Heritage 1866". Enshrined in a legacy spanning 158 years, this illustrious residence is the cherished property of late Shri Chathoth Rairu Nair - a man of unwavering spirit, a freedom fighter, disciple of Gandhi, accomplished businessman, and a prominent social figure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Known affectionately as "Rairuettan" to friends and well-wishers, his fascination with the Indian freedom struggle started at a very young age. This led him to work with Mahatma Gandhi in Wardha and later, to join the Indian National Army under Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Upon returning to Thalassery, Rairu Nair became closely associated with the Communist movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Judge Bungalow has, for decades, been a silent witness to history, hosting dignitaries from various walks of life. Now, as Heritage 1866 transforms into a premium heritage home, it continues the legacy of warm hospitality, comfortable accommodation, and authentic local delicacies. The traditional Kerala nalukettu style architecture envelops guests in a luxurious vintage ambiance, with interiors adorned in fine wood and antique furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
        What makes Heritage 1866 even more special is its treasure trove of artifacts, including a kooja gifted by Subhas Chandra Bose, adding a touch of historical significance to the vintage interiors. Each place within this century-old home tells a story, preserving the rich heritage it holds.
    </p>
    <p>

The vibrant local experiences include the enchanting theyyam performances, savoring the local cuisine, strolling along the pristine beaches, trying their hand at fishing, witnessing the age-old art of coir making, and engaging in authentic village experiences.
    </p>
    <p>

We invite you not only to relish the charm of this heritage home but also to explore the enriching experiences that Thalassery has to offer.
